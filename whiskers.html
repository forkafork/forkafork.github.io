                    <p>Whiskers has always wanted to be a hero. He had posters of the most powerful heroes everywhere. He kept making new costumes for himself and wore them to kindergarten where the other kids would bully him. But this did not discourage him because he knew soon his superpower puberty would kick in. What power would he get? Super strength? Super speed? Super intelligence? Only time would tell. One day in class the teacher was explaining what the perfect race is. "Der perfect humanz muzt haz blond hairz, white skinz, stronk cheekbonez, and der blue eyez... now line up kinder we shall zee if you are der uber mensch!!!" Whiskers was worried because he did not have blue eyes... his eyes were as black as the midnight sky. The teacher went from child to child scoring their looks, and then he reached Whiskers.</p><p>Whiskers was so scared he closed his eyes. "Open ze eyez Whiskerz or I shall smacket ze with mein fuhrer... I mean mein ruler!" the teacher said. Whiskers slowly opened his eyes and the teacher went "Ah sehr gut, der blue eyez. NEXT!" Whiskers was shocked... he ran home after school to look at the mirror and now his eyes were green. He showed his mom and dad and they reported it to the government. After some testing the government ranked his power as F because it is one of the most useless powers they had ever seen. Whiskers entered an eternal depression.</p>
