                    <p>Ano is the child of very rich parents. Whenever she wanted stuff from the store, they bought it for her. But her life suddenly changed when she tried to get her mom to buy a banana from a sexy banana salesman. She walked up to the hot banana man and yelled "Ma-HOT-ma Gandhi!!!!!" and the banana salesman started blushing and giving her all of his bananas. Everyone at the store knew what happened, little Ano had just reched her superpower puberty. The government showed up to register her power shortly after and ranked it the lowest rank because it would only be useful against sexy villains. The government later signed Ano up for manditory hero school where she would learn how to control and improve her power. She could only hope for sexy teachers so that she could get the best grades without doing any work.</p>
