                    <p>Val grew up near a beach where a lot of white priviledged men go to surf and a lot of war veteran hobos go to do drugs and sleep. He spent time with both of these groups of people where he picked up his shark fetish and an insatiable desire to smoke weed. This has had a profound impact on his speech making him sound like a hippy. One day as Val was sitting under a palm tree smoking a huge spliff he heard someone yelling "Fish guts, Fish meat, Food, Food, Food!" He looked around but all of the hobos were unconcious. "Food, Fish, Eat!" He heard again, it sounded like it was coming from the sky. He looked up and there was a seagull making these noises. "Woah dude, is that bird talking like a person? Thats rad dude huehuehue!"</p> <p>Val would later tell his white friends about that experience so they put him to the test by making him high again and taking him to a pet store. His friends took him near a chirping bird in a cage and asked him to translate what the bird was saying. "Poop, poop, poop!" He told his friends, and moments later the bird took a shit. Everyone was impressed and started high-fiving eachother. The store owner showed up and asked them what they were celebrating. After they explained, the store owner informed the autorities who captured Val and registered his power as a rank F! This power was useless because birds don't have much to say and they dont understand human languages so you cannot communicate with them. Val would then be given a medical marijuana license and sent to hero school in hopes of improving his ability somehow. </p>
