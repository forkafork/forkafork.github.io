                    <p>Sten was born in the poorest part of the richest city to a family of low-life gangsters. His upbringing was rough because in the hood where he lived existed a wild dachshund also knows as a weiner doge. This doge would constantly bite Sten's ankles and bark at him until Sten offered anything edible as a form of tax. This was a real bully doge who ran these streets with ruthless efficiency. But one day as Sten was thinking really hard and scratching his head, all of his hair fell off. He freaked out and ran out onto the streets panicking as people started laughing that he was bald. But then the king of the street showed up and started barking for food. Sten didn't have anything on him so the doge launched himself like a rocket as Sten put his hands up for protection. Sten was knocked down by the doge covered in loose hair. The doge had also lost its hair instantly when touched by Sten's hands. It ran away whimpering and Sten stood up spitting fur out of his mouth and realizing that he has just discovered his superpower! People informed the government and they did some tests on Sten at a local waxing business where he gave everyone a brazilian for free. His power was ranked as the second worst rank, E, because it would cause panic among villains if Sten touched them.</p>
