                    <p>Blinky was a cool guy who could play guitar. He had long curly hair sitting on top of trees with a toothpick in his mouth, playing his broken acoustic guitar with only 1 string. His dad was a massive religious nut who hated happiness so he kept yelling at poor Bloo whenever he played guitar. Blinky would often run away and try to pick up girls so they could support him financially until his music career kicked off. This was very mature because he was only 10 years old. One day as Blinky was tuning his guitar string his dad got super angry and started telling him to read their holy book. Blinky refused and his dad went to slap him but Blinky's hair wrapped around his dad's hand surprising both of them. "Wut in de hell is dis boy! You demon child of satan! Shazam!" Blinky's dad used his other hand to slap him repeatedly. Even though he could control his hair, its hair, it does not have much physical strength. His hair poked his dad in the eyes so he could escape for good.</p>
                    <p>Blooblina roamed the streets for days stealing leftover pizza from rats to survive. One day he got serious food poisoning and passed out. He woke up in the hospital with a bunch of government agents holding charts and discussing random government stuff next to him. He asked what was happening and they explained that his hair was flapping around when he was unconscious. They registered his superpower under rank F and signed him up for hero school. Bloo was happy because finally he will have somewhere to live. And maybe there are some rich girls over there.</p>
