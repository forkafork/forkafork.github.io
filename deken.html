                    <p>We have scarce information on this subject because he avoided the government his whole life, his unique ability makes it easy for him to slip away. What we managed to gather from people who knew him was that his power grants him the ability to manifest a random mustache on his face. He does not have any choice on the matter. We have reports that he tried to blend in near a Jewish synagogue one day and his ability manifested a Hitler mustache. He was chased for 16 blocks until he finally managed to change it into a Charlie Chaplin mustache to get away. His "friends" told us that they do not know when he first got his ability, but the first time they saw it, he was was being rejected by multiple girls inside a mall and then running away, changing mustache in the restrooms then trying again. He only had one pickup line which was "rate my face from 0 to 10".</p><p>The government tried to catch him many times to register his identity and power but all they found were old discarded mustaches. The word on the street now is that he has disappeared. The last witness who saw him was an old trash collector who said that Deken was in an alleyway talking to a strange figure in a trench coat. Who could this figure be and what did he do with Deken? The government was forced to rank his ability based on witness statements and gave it an F rank. If Deken ever learns how to pick the mustache himself, it would most likely upgrade to an E rank!</p>
