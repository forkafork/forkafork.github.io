                    <p>Shuri is Ano's twin syster but her parents didnt notice it from the start, she was so little that the doctors threw her into the trash by mistake. The strange thing is her sister was big and chubby whereas Shuri was super tiny and skinny. Doctors explained that Ano stole all the neutrients in the belly. This actually continued throughout Shuri's life, Ano got everything and all Shuri had was tiny sneks which lived in the back garden. Shuri is the exact opposite of Ano and this is also true when it comes to their powers.</p><p>First time Shuri used her powers by mistake was when an ugly ass milkman showed up to drop off some milk. He rang the doorbell, Shuri opened and instinctively blurted out "Deskusten!!!". The poor milkman was stunned, he dropped his milk and started crying. Shuri's parents stopped brushing Ano's hair and ran to the door to see what was happening. After a short investigation they figured out that Shuri had devloped the power to hurt ugly people's feelings. The exact opposite power of her twin syster! What are the odds? The government arrived that same day to register the power as an F rank and sign Shuri into the same hero school as her syster.</p>
